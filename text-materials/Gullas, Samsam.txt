GERALD ANTHONY GULLAS JR.
Cebu Province, First District

First-time politician Gerald Anthony Gullas Jr. ran unopposed in the May 2013 election and began his term as representative of the first district of Cebu Province last June 30, 2013.
So far, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has not reported any release of Gullas' Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF). The Supreme Court restrained the use of the 2013 PDAF in an order last September.
