CLAVEL MARTINEZ
Cebu Province, Fourth District 

Lawyer Clavel Asas-Martinez served as congresswoman of the fourth district of Cebu Province from 1998 to 2007. She succeeded her husband Celestino Martinez Jr., who also served three consecutive terms, from 1987 to 1998.
In August 2013, the Sandiganbayan ordered the arrest of Clavel Martinez, her son former Bogo City Mayor Celestino III and five other local officials. It found basis to try her for malversation, amid charges she kept P10 million of her Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF) in 2002 and 2003, even if these funds were supposed to go to the Girl Scouts of the Philippines. 
The Sandiganbayan later deferred the enforcement of the warrant, while it considered a motion to dismiss filed by the Martinez camp.
The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has made available online only the PDAF releases from 2009 to 2013, so far.
