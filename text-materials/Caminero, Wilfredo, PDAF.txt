WILFREDO CAMINERO
Cebu Province, Second District

Former Cebu Provincial Board Member Wilfredo Caminero defeated veteran congressman Pablo Garcia in the May 2013 election, for his first term as representative of Cebu Province's second district.
The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has yet to release Caminero's share of the Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF). In September 2013, while government agencies and commissions investigated allegations the PDAF was misused, the Supreme Court stopped the release of all PDAF shares for this year.
