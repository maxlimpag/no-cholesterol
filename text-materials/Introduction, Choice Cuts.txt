HOW did Cebu's lawmakers spend their Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF)? Which agencies and towns received  amounts, and what projects and services did they spend the funds on?
"Choice Cuts: Cebu and the Pork Barrel" is Sun.Star Cebu's attempt to  help taxpayers and concerned citizens track down where our PDAF shares went. Because it is our PDAF; the lawmakers we elect are supposed to funnel these amounts into projects and services that serve our needs.
The information here is based on PDAF releases from 2009 to 2013, as disclosed by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). 
Cited, as well, is a Commission on Audit (COA) report on how the PDAF was spent in 2007 to 2009, and how billions of it went to dubious non-government organizations (NGOs) that have yet to fully account for where the money went.
If you have any information on how our Cebuano lawmakers' PDAF-supported projects are doing, or if you simply want to discuss your suggestions for reforming the pork barrel system, email us at centralnewsroom@gmail.com, centralnewsroom@sunstar.com.ph or edinchief@sunstar.com.ph.
