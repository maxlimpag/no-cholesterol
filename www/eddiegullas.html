			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			
			<p>HOW did Cebu's lawmakers spend their Priority Development Assistance Funds (PDAF)? Which agencies and towns received  amounts, and what projects and services did they spend the funds on?</p>
			<p>"Choice Cuts: Cebu and the Pork Barrel" is <strong>Sun.Star Cebu</strong>'s attempt to  help taxpayers and concerned citizens track down where <em>our PDAF</em> shares went. Because it is our PDAF; the lawmakers we elect are supposed to funnel these amounts into projects and services that serve <em>our</em> needs.</p>
			<p>The information here is based on PDAF releases from 2009 to 2013, as disclosed by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).</p> 
			<p>Cited, as well, is a Commission on Audit (COA) report on how the PDAF was spent in 2007 to 2009, and how billions of it went to dubious non-government organizations (NGOs) that have yet to fully account for where the money went.</p>
			<p>If you have any information on how our Cebuano lawmakers' PDAF-supported projects are doing, or if you simply want to discuss your suggestions for reforming the pork barrel system, <a href="mailto:centralnewsroom@gmail.com,centralnewsroom@sunstar.com.ph,edinchief@sunstar.com.ph">send us an email</a>.
